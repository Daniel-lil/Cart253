# Template p5 project
This project is my attempt at creating an interactive audio visualizer for music which can create interesting dynamic visuals and be easy to use.
This visualizer can be used at all kinds of events for example dj events, parties or everyday home just home use. I find it to be very fun to play with
and my hypnotic, it can be used for long periods of time without boredom which I feel is successful, it also functions just how I'd like.
There are for main patterns which can be swapped between with keys 1234, the colour scheme is controllable with keys z through to the comma key
and there are also backgrounds that can be added by holding down a s and d.
